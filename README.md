The goal of this project is to simulate the viscous damped
vibrations. A theoretical and mathematical model of the
damping system will be developed, and the resulting
system of equations will be solved numerically
on a computer.

The specific objectives are presented below:
1. Develop a physical model of a viscous damping system.
2. Make suitable assumptions and to make the problem
tractable
3. Derive the governing equations from first principles
4. Formulate the initial and boundary conditions
5. Adopt judicious numerical schemes to conduct a
numerical analysis
6. Analyse the various cases of damping and parameters.
7. Write a computer program to solve the equations and
obtain solutions
9. Determine the motion profile of the system.
